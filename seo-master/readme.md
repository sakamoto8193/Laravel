## Laravel SEO admin

This application demonstrates usage of polymorphic relationships described at (http://maxoffsky.com/code-blog/using-polymorphic-relationships-of-laravel-for-seo-content/) for SEO data of your application.

The admin panel for seo is at "admin/seo" URL (relative to the application's root)

You can add/edit title, description and keywords for multiple types of data in the application by using polymorphic relationships.

The controller that deals with the SEO administration is in app/controllers/Admin/SeoController.php
Feel free to modify it to add more types of data that you want to include in the SEO administration.
